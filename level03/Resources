So, we have an executable
Reading it, it is gibberish but we can see on the top that it is an elf file.
After much researching and learning what it is, we can begin to work with it
Using elfread to check what is inside.
Is it a text that is hidden in data ? nope
Using gdb to put breakpoints and check if the values are at one time hidden ? nope
THEN WE SEE (could have been much earlier ...) that there are a few functions, strange ones we can worth with.
setresuid, setresgid, system...
Yep that's it. It basically runs what is in system as root, something we cannot do on the bash
After thinking for a while what we can do, it is pretty easy to say change the path where the program is searching "echo" to another "echo" that is selfmade.
Well, do we try to get that flag now ? getflag ? 
AAANNNNNNDDDD it works
